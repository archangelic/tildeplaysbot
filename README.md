# tildeplaysbot
A bot to play games using commands in the tilde.town chat!

## Note

The `minerobberpls` branch is not ready for merging yet but I figured I'd add it here all the same as I fix it up.

All of my PRs past the 2nd one have had terrible bugs, and as such, I'm undoing them. I'll re-add specific changes
from them, and maybe then this can be merged to master.

Goals:

 - [X] Revert to `2d32ea8c - can start stream from chat`
 - [ ] Re-add shutdown command in weaker form - i.e; use it to signify that the processes behind the stream have been killed
 - [ ] Re-add help command
